## Word Guess Game
This program takes a text file, calculates its lexical diversity, tokenizes it, and plays a word guessing game based on the most common nouns in the document. The code for the project can be viewed [here](homework2_htk180000.py).

### How To Run
Use Python3 to run the homework2_htk180000.py file in the word_guess_game folder and provide a path to the data file. For example:

> python homework1_htk180000.py data.txt

Note: this program uses the NLTK library and requires that nltk.download() have already been used to download corpora data. I used nltk.download('all') to get all available data.
